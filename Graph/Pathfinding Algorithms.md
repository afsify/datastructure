# **Pathfinding Algorithms**

Pathfinding algorithms are used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which can be applied in various fields such as computer science, robotics, and game development.

## **1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

### **Overview**
- **Purpose**: To find the shortest path from a starting node (source) to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- **Type**: Greedy algorithm, which means it makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

### **How It Works**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a priority queue (or min-heap) to store nodes based on their current shortest distance from the source.
   - Set the distance to the source node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.
   - Mark all nodes as unvisited.

2. **Process Nodes**:
   - While there are unvisited nodes:
     - Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.
     - For each neighbor of the extracted node:
       - Calculate the distance from the source to the neighbor through the current node.
       - If this distance is less than the known distance to the neighbor, update the distance and set the current node as the predecessor.

3. **Repeat** until all nodes have been visited or the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes is infinity (indicating that remaining unvisited nodes are unreachable).

4. **Construct the Path**:
   - To find the shortest path to a specific target node, backtrack from the target using the predecessors stored during the process.

### **Time Complexity**
- **O((V + E) log V)**, where \( V \) is the number of vertices and \( E \) is the number of edges. The logarithmic factor comes from the priority queue operations.

### **Example**
- Given a graph with nodes A, B, C, and D, where the edges have weights (costs), Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used to find the shortest path from A to all other nodes, resulting in distances such as:
  - Distance from A to B = 5
  - Distance from A to C = 10
  - Distance from A to D = 15

## **2. A* Search Algorithm**

### **Overview**
- **Purpose**: To find the shortest path from a starting node to a goal node in a weighted graph, while using heuristics to optimize the search.
- **Type**: Best-first search algorithm, which means it evaluates nodes based on the lowest cost function.

### **How It Works**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two sets: open set (nodes to be evaluated) and closed set (nodes already evaluated).
   - Initialize the open set with the starting node.
   - Set the cost from the start node to itself as 0.

2. **Process Nodes**:
   - While the open set is not empty:
     - Find the node in the open set with the lowest cost function \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \), where:
       - \( g(n) \) is the actual cost from the start node to node \( n \).
       - \( h(n) \) is the heuristic estimated cost from node \( n \) to the goal node (commonly the straight-line distance).
     - If the current node is the goal node, reconstruct the path and return it.
     - Otherwise, move the current node to the closed set.
     - For each neighbor of the current node:
       - If it is in the closed set, ignore it.
       - Calculate the tentative cost \( g \) for the neighbor.
       - If it is not in the open set or the tentative cost is lower than the previously recorded cost, update the cost and set the current node as the predecessor. Add the neighbor to the open set if it is not already there.

3. **Repeat** until the open set is empty (indicating no path exists) or the goal is reached.

### **Time Complexity**
- **O(E)**, where \( E \) is the number of edges, but can vary depending on the heuristic used. A good heuristic can significantly speed up the search.

### **Example**
- Given a graph with nodes and heuristic values (estimated distance to the goal), A* would efficiently explore the most promising paths first, leading to a potentially shorter path compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, especially when the graph has a large number of nodes.

---

### **Conclusion**

Both Dijkstra’s Algorithm and the A* Search Algorithm are powerful tools for pathfinding in weighted graphs. Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees the shortest path to all nodes, while A* optimizes the search using heuristics to focus on paths that are more likely to lead to the goal. Understanding the strengths and use cases of each algorithm is crucial for selecting the right approach based on the problem at hand.
