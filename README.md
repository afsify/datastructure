# JavaScript Data Structure Library

Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently, A simple JavaScript library providing commonly used data structures.

## Overview

This library offers a collection of fundamental data structures implemented in JavaScript. These data structures are essential for various algorithms and applications, offering efficient ways to organize and manipulate data.

## Supported Data Structures

1. **Array:**
   - A collection of elements identified by index or key.

2. **Graph:**
   - A collection of nodes connected by edges.

3. **HashTable:**
   - A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.

4. **Heap:**
   - A specialized tree-based data structure where the parent node is greater (or smaller) than its children.

5. **LinkedList:**
   - A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.

6. **Map:**
   - A collection of key-value pairs where each key must be unique.

7. **Queue:**
   - A First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure, where the first added element is the first one to be removed.

8. **Recursion:**
   - A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the problem.

9. **Search Algorithms:**
   - Common algorithms like Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.

10. **Set:**
    - A collection of unique elements.

11. **Sort Algorithms:**
    - Common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

12. **Stack:**
    - A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, where the last added element is the first one to be removed.

13. **String:**
    - A sequence of characters.

14. **Tree:**
    - A hierarchical data structure with a root element and subtrees.

15. **Trie:**
    - A tree-like data structure where the keys are usually strings.
